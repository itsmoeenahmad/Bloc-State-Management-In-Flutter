# flutter_bloc

Here you will learned all about bloc state management in flutter.

**Full Notes About BLOC State Management In Flutter:** 

*  Firstly bloc stands for Business Logic Component.
*  Bloc State management is used for complex projects because it is easy to test, read and modify.
*  Bloc separate the code, that's why it is event-driven. It generate/make an event for doing something.
*  Let suppose we are fetching some data from server, firstly it will create an event, call the bloc and then bloc will check or make a connection with server for fetching the required data once bloc receive the required data then it will response with a state which will shows/returns the required data.
*  If we compare bloc with cubit then bloc is used for complex projects and it is event-driven while cubit is used for complex as well as less complex projects & also cubit is not event-driven it trigger the functions.
Three package we will be using for flutter:
* i- Bloc: For Writing the bloc code.
* ii- FlutterBloc: For Writing the Flutter Related Bloc code.
* iii- Equatable: For Minimizing the code. 
For Each Topic/Concept in bloc its notes is present in its file.
